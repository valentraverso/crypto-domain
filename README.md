## Previous Settings ⚙

Here we will teach you config and install our app in you local desktop.

### Settings the path ⨓

The file to modify: ./src/controllers/pathControllers.php
We use two differents type of paths:

#### BASE_URL 

Which refers to the relative path where your localhost runs.

You need to after it's indicated, and your route its going to see like:

    define ('BASE_URL', 'http://'.$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'].'/assembler/develop-your-project-in-php');

#### BASE_PATH

Then you must change the absolute path wich it's going to help when differents files requires others.

You need to fullfill after where it's indicated, and it's going to see like this:

    define ('BASE_PATH', $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'].'/assembler/develop-your-project-in-php');

🤔 Reminder: Both dynamic path text need to be the same.
